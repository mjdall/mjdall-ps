# mjdall
## What is it?
Small personal static site. I currently don't have much to show for what I can do web development wise. This is going to be that project where I can show partially some of my web development skills. Since it's not a project with any requirements per say, I'm just going to wing it, not care all too much about commit standards but just enjoy a small little project.

## Where is this deployed?
Planning on hosting at mjdall.com. Will update once actually deployed.

## Personal Notes / Partial Planning
* Learn [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    * I've only really watched small talks about TS
    * I've been meaning to learn it for awhile
    * Going to set up gatsby and then get familar with TS
* Make the website jazzy
    * I've done a bit of css/scss animations, it's time to go overboard and learn a few more

## Framework Planning
* [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/)
    * good for havging multiple pages on the site
    * i really want to learn this framework
    * i did start some boiler plate next js
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
    * have a single page that doesn't have any other routes.
    * i'm kind of leaning in this direction, however I do want to use a different framework other than create-react-app
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
    * quote from create-react-app: "If your website is mostly static (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using Gatsby instead."
    * going to go with Gatsby
